## Style Guide
Please stricly follow the [Airbnb React Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/) for us to sucessfully communicate with other developers/teammates. Also when trying to push something, please make a branch and create a pull request. This will enable the team to track all changes within the codebase.

## Pull Request Process
1. Ensure that your changes are simple and readable. Follow good programming principles such as [DRY](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-dry-development), [KISS](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/20262/keep-it-simple-stupid-principle-kiss-principle), and [YAGNI](https://deviq.com/principles/yagni).
2. Make sure to follow the style guide mentioned above for consistent and reliable development process.
3. Make sure to remove redudant **spaces** and **comments** that are not needed in the current project.
4. Update any documents that may have been affected by your code changes. This might be any comments written by the developers or simply just markdowns that explain any implementation, details, etc.
